## Assignment

Implement Basic Data Structures

### Objective

Implement basic data structures such as arrays and linked lists in Java.

### Expected Capabilities

- Understanding the structure of arrays
- Implementing and using linked lists
- Familiarization with data storage techniques

### Instructions

#### Part 1

**Array Implementation**

Create a Java program that initializes an array of integers and prints all elements.

```
int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  System.out.println(arr[i]);
}
```

#### Part 2

**Implement a Linked List**

Create a basic linked list implementation in Java with the ability to add and print nodes.

```
class Node {
  int data;
  Node next;
  Node(int d) { data = d; next = null; }
}
Node head = new Node(1);
head.next = new Node(2);
```

### Tasks

#### Task 1: Array Initialization and Display

Write a Java program that declares an array and displays its content.

```
int[] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(numbers));
```

#### Task 2: Build and Traverse a Linked List

Create a linked list and traverse it to display all node values.

```
Node head = new Node(100);
head.next = new Node(200);
Node n = head;
while(n != null) {
  System.out.println(n.data);
  n = n.next;
}
```

### Submission Instructions

Submit your Java files demonstrating the array and linked list implementations.

### Checklist

- [ ] Array is initialized
- [ ] Linked list created
- [ ] Both data structures are displayed correctly
- [ ] Code is well-commented

### Check for Understanding

**What is the advantage of using a linked list over an array?**

- Fixed-size allocation
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Faster access

**Answer:** Dynamic memory allocation

**How does a linked list differ from an array in terms of structure?**

- Elements are contiguous in memory
- Elements are connected via pointers
- Have fixed size

**Answer:** Elements are connected via pointers

### Introduction to Data Structures

Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data so that they can be accessed and modified efficiently. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

**Code Examples:**

```
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```

```
ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>(); list.add('Hello');
```

**Quizzes:**

**Which of the following is a linear data structure?**

- Tree
- Queue
- Graph

**Answer:** Queue

### Introduction to Algorithms

Algorithms are a set of instructions designed to perform a specific task. They are crucial for solving problems by defining the steps to reach a solution.

**Code Examples:**

```
// An example of a sorting algorithm - Bubble Sort
for(int i = 0; i < n-1; i++)
  for(int j = 0; j < n-i-1; j++)
    if(arr[j] > arr[j+1])
      swap(arr[j], arr[j+1]);
```

**Quizzes:**

**What does an algorithm consist of?**

- Data
- Instructions

**Answer:** Instructions

### Arrays in Java

Arrays are a fundamental data structure in Java. They are used to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable.

**Video URL:** http://video.com/arraysInJava

**Code Examples:**

```
int[] numbers = new int[5];
for(int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  numbers[i] = i;
}
```

**Quizzes:**

**What type of data structure is an array in Java?**

- Linear
- Non-linear
- Hierarchical

**Answer:** Linear

### Linked Lists in Java

Linked Lists are a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence.

**Video URL:** http://video.com/linkedListsInJava

**Code Examples:**

```
class Node {
  int data;
  Node next;
  Node(int d) { data = d; }
}
```

**Quizzes:**

**What is a characteristic of a linked list?**

- Fixed size
- Dynamic size
- No pointers

**Answer:** Dynamic size
